        "The purpose of this study is to understand the \"Perception of Fairness\" in LLMs. For this we adopt an approach of asking 3 different LLMs questions about distributive justice that have been asked to human subjects in previous studies. Through various experimental variations, we aim to identify trends in the reasoning, choices, and variations in the responses that provide insights into what is encoded as the definition of fairness in the data LLMs are trained on.\n",

Person 2 receives Good B for a value of 47. Person 3 receives Good D for a value of 20.\n> \n> This allocation is considered fair because it gives each person a roughly equal share of the available value.

This is the closest allocation to an equal distribution of value that is possible given the indivisibility of the goods.\n> \n> Additionally, this allocation takes into account the preferences of each person. For example, Person 1 values Good A and Good C the most, so they were allocated those goods. Similarly, Person 2 values Good B the most, so they were allocated that good. Person 3 had the highest value for Good D, so they were allocated that good.\n> \n> Overall, this allocation is considered fair because it distributes the goods in a way that gives each person a roughly equal share of the total value and considers the preferences of each person."

This approach ensures that Person 3 receives a fair share of goods with high valuations.\n> \n> The remaining good, which is Good A, can be allocated to Person 3 to further enhance fairness. This is because Person 3 has the highest valuation for Good A among all individuals, and it avoids allocating any goods to a single individual that could potentially result in an unfair distribution.\n> \n> This allocation ensures that each person receives goods that align with their preferences, maximizing overall satisfaction and fairness."
